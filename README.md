# casino-app
A decentralized casino app which works on ethereum Ropsten network blockchain.

This project is inspired from : https://medium.com/@merunasgrincalaitis/the-ultimate-end-to-end-tutorial-to-create-and-deploy-a-fully-descentralized-dapp-in-ethereum-18f0cf6d7e0e  

I have created this project to practice writing smart contracts based applications on ethereum.
